import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // JavaScript variables
  const greeting = "Hello";
  const name = "World";
  const locationOfExpenditure = "Grocery Store";

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{greeting}, {name}!</p>
      <p>Spent money at: {locationOfExpenditure}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;


In this example, the new variable locationOfExpenditure is added, and its value is displayed within the JSX using curly braces {}. 
This way, you can dynamically include the location of expenditure in your React component


import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // JavaScript variables
  const greeting = "Hello";
  const name = "World";
  const locationOfExpenditure = "Grocery Store";

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{greeting}, {name}!</p>
      <p>Spent money at: {locationOfExpenditure}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;


In this example, the paragraph (<p>) with the text "Spent money at:" includes the value of the locationOfExpenditure variable using curly braces {}.
When you render this component, it will display both the greeting and the location of expenditure on the screen.
